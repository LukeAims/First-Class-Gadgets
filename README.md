*At the end of this project I will have created a website named First Class Gadgets. I have demonstrated element structure and semantic meaning. I will have used images, links, main, header, aside, nav and footer. Along with h, a and p elements, lists, section and div. I have also used commenting out and examples of html entities to add symbols..*
