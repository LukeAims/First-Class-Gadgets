This is my interpretation of a project that is part of the Full Stack Development course, by Chris Dixon. 
====================================================
At the end of this 3 page project I will have created a website named First Class Gadgets.
----------------------------------------------------

### **Index.html** <br> 

**This page demonstrates the use of element structure and semantic meaning. I have used img src, link, main, header, aside, nav and footer. Along with h, a and p elements, list, section and div. I have also used commenting out and examples of html entities to add symbols..**

CSS

### **Product_details.html** <br> 
**This html page demonstrates everything from index.html, with the additional elements of input type search and meta name viewport. I also created a table by adding the table element and using thead,tbody,th, tr and td options. I then added a caption to the table.**

CSS

### **Contact.html**
**In this html page I have used the lable element to link to my input forms contained in a div element. I used the following form types to demonstrate my knowledge, Text, Email, Checkbox, Radio, Reset and submit. I added a Select box to create a dropdown menu and used optgroup to group the option values together. I then added Favicons to all 3 pages. I also used the iframe element to embed a google maps API to highlight my basic knowledge of API's. I have added the aditional code div, lable, input type="text" list="subject" datalist and option to create a dropdown menu using the newer html5 datalist element. I then commented the datalist out in favour of using the select box due to browser support issues.**

**You can view this site on Git Pages.**
