This is my interpretation of a project that is part of the Full Stack Development course, by Chris Dixon. 
====================================================
At the end of this 3 page project I will have created a website named First Class Gadgets.
----------------------------------------------------

### **Index.html** <br> 

**This page demonstrates the use of element structure and semantic meaning. I have used img src, link, main, header, aside, nav and footer. Along with h, a and p elements, list, section and div. I have also used commenting out and examples of html entities to add symbols..**

CSS

### **Product_details.html** <br> 
**This html page demonstrates everything from index.html, with the addition of tables and meta name viewport. I also used The thead, th, tr, td, tbody and caption elements.**

CSS

### **Contact.html**
**In this html page I have demonstrated everything from index.html and product_details.htms, with the addition of Input type, text, checkbox, email and radio. I have also added textarea,submit button and demonstrated datalists, along with label element for each div section. Highlighted the use of a favicon for my titlebars**

**You can view this site on Git Pages.**
