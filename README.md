# This is my interpretation of a project that is part of the Full Stack Development course, by Chris Dixon. 

**At the end of this project I will have created a website named First Class Gadgets.**

Index.html
*This page demonstrates the use of element structure and semantic meaning. I have used img src, link, main, header, aside, nav and footer. Along with h, a and p elements, list, section and div. I have also used commenting out and examples of html entities to add symbols..*

CSS

Product_details.html
*In this html document I have demonstrated everything from index.html, with the addition of tables and meta name viewport. I used The thead, th, tr, td, tbody and caption elements.*

CSS

**You can view this site on Git Pages.**
